            <p>Hi! Welcome to the Mobile Gallery, the No 1 mobile store in town. With our decade of experience and expertise we can help you with any new purchase  weather it is a smartphone, smartwatch or tablet. Not just devices but we also keep a huge stock of accessories that you may need like phone case, adapters, storage devices and cables. We know we are the best because of the feedback we get from our customers which testifies that we stand true to our promises.</p>
            <p>The brands we offer in smartphones are Apple, Samsung, Google, Asus, etc. All of these brands are trusted by the user as much as the merchant. We provide financing on any new purchase, even 0% financing is also available (ofcourse depending on your credit). With new purchase you can personalize your phone with the accessories available at store form brands such as Otterbox, Casetify, RhinoShield, etc.</p>
            <p>Also, this festive season we are happy to announce exciting offers. We will be giving guaranteed Gift Card to our customers on every smartphone purchase above $1000 and the Gift Cards are worth $25 - $150. These Gift Cards are not available for devices purchased under any financing scheme and this offer will be vaild until the stocks last. If that was not enough then you can opt for $50 which could be redeemed in terms of accessories in store but keep in mind that the purchase value should be over $1000. Both of these offers are vaild until 31 December, 2022. So, visit us today and get extra discounts* / offers* where ever applicable.</p>
            <p>We opened our store in 2012 which marks this year i.e. 2022 as our 10th year anniversory. Throughout the years we were consistant towards one thing that is customer satisfaction weather it may be giving them best possible discounts, offers or advice on what they should go for. All this time we have never been faced an issue where the customer was not satisfied or not happy with a purchase they made through us. We have also stood with our society whenever they needed us like donating towards a cause, giving out food in the time of the pandemic, supporting our employees when they needed any kind of help wheather monetory or anything else. With your trust and cooperation we have sustained for so long and we will try to do the same for the years to come.</p>
            <p>We have also a particular section for the repairs of devices. Whatever it may be screen damage, charging not working or any other issue we will assisat you with the best possible repairs on a budget. Particularly for apple devices if you've opted for the apple care then in case you need any support you can visit our store to get the repairs done by a specialist from Apple. There is also 7 day returns on items where ever applicable.</p>
            <p>Our location is based in Mississauga being is accessible to the whole GTA region. We are also planning to open a new store in Brampton so that we can serve you people better.</p>
