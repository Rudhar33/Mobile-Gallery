✓ We have used HTML 5.0 & CSS 3.0

Why HTML 5 ?
- In this project we used HTML to create the sturcture of the
webpages. There are some particular reasons why we chose HTML 5
over previous versions.
1. It has improved semantics i.e. some new types of tags were
introduced in HTML 5 that help in better representation of data
such as <header>, <footer> and <aside>. These are some of the
tags which were introduced to make the code more semantic
than before.
The new tags are very important as they make the page more
structured. It is helpful while developing the webapp, while
installing a plugin and it improves the readability of the code.
Another benefit of this would be in terms of SEO as the search
engines would be able to understand the contents of the page.
2. Performance improvement. We all hate waiting when a page is
loading and we have to sit idle in front of the screen. HTML 5
tries to tackle this issue by allowing some script tags to load
independently from rest of the page. Like there is a preload
attribute for videos which allows the video to load as soon as the
page is clicked on allowing the user to instantly stream the video
as soon as he opens it.
3. It also adds offline support. So, even when you’ve offline you
can interact with the webpage. The technologies which help us
to do this are :-
• AppCache
• Service Workers
4. Audio video support was added. In HTML 5 we can add media
to the webpage using standard tags which was possible
previosly by plugins. These tags also give user the options to
control the playback.
5. Storage of data locally or in a database. This gives the developer
the flexibility to store data as per his needs or objectives.

Why CSS 3?
CSS 3 is the latest version of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). With this
new version we get improvements / features such as –
1. CSS 3 is economical and time saving. With this, it is also
supported by most of the web browsers making it adaptable to
multiple devices.
2. Implementation of graphics is easier in CSS 3, this helps in
making the website more appealing to the user.
3. We can use effieicent CSS modules to change many files at
once.
4. It provides consistent and precise positioning of navigable
elements.
5. Permits online videos to be seen without the need of any
external plugin.

➢ Design Featurs we have used:-
1. Responsive design so that users can view our site on any
device either mobile or desktop with proper alignment.
The elements change shape and sizes according to the
screen size.
2. Made our website is mobile friendly
3. Yes our site is SEO optimised - we have used proper meta
description & keywords in each of the pages so that it can
easily be ranked on search engines & we can drive organic
